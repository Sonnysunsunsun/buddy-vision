## 🎤 Demo Script (2 Minutes)

### Setup (30 seconds)
"Buddy Vision solves a critical problem: blind Olympic visitors need more than object lists - they need human context. We distribute through Special Olympics and Best Buddies, not app stores."

### Live Demo (90 seconds)
1. "Sarah is a Special Olympics swimmer at Staples Center"
2. "Her coach texts her our link" [show partner referral]
3. "One-click setup with coach help"
4. "Now watch the difference..." [capture scene]
5. "Instead of 'multiple people detected,' Buddy Vision says..."
6. [Voice speaks contextual description]

### Impact (30 seconds)
