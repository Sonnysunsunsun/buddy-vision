LA 2028 will host millions of visitors with diverse accessibility needs:
- **Visually impaired** individuals navigating unfamiliar venues
- **Non-English speakers** needing instant translations
- **Elderly visitors** requiring clear navigation help
- **Tourists** unfamiliar with Olympic venues

Current solutions are fragmented, require human volunteers (not scalable), or only serve one audience.
